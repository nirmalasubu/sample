##Delivery Queues<a name="DeliveryQueues"></a>  
The first page of the Delivery Queue area is the delivery queue main grid. At the bottom of the page is the pagination area where users can flip through each page to see the queue records of interest. While viewing the grid page, a user may do any of the following:  

* Filter the delivery queue grid
* Navigate to the Editing page
* Clear all undelivered notifications
* Resend all notifications
* Purge all notifications
* View notification history
* Create a Query by Date Range
* View all active and inactive queues


####Filtering<a name="filtering"></a>  
A user may filter the grid by using the suggestive search. This means any partial entry in the filter fields will display records in the grid that match that criteria.   
There are 3 ways the grid can be filtered:

* Queue Name
* Contact Email
* Queue ID

The user also has the ability to clear the filters by clicking the "Clear All Filters" link to the right of the filter fields. This action will clear all the filters the user has entered in any of the 3 fields mentioned above and the grid will return to its original state with all records displayed.


####Create a new delivery queue<a name="createnew"></a>  
If the user wishes to create a new delivery queue, a link to do so can be found in the top right corner of the grid. This link will take the user to a new page where all pertinent information can be entered. At anytime a user wishes to get back to the main grid, the main navigation tabs on the left of the page may be used.
